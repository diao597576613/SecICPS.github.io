            <p>Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), sensing, communication, computation and storage techniques have improved the way CPS interact, 
                exchange and process information. Especially in recent years, Intelligent Cyber-Physical System (ICPS), 
                such as unmanned vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and robots, have emerged for various applications without surveillance by human.
                Yet, the success, prosperity, and advancement of these intelligent systems strongly depend on the security and safety of the cyber-physical devices, 
                system software, and application software. These systems are prone to suffering from various security and safety issues, such as hardware defects, 
                system and application vulnerabilities, network eavesdropping, side-channel attacks and so on. These successful attacks targeted to the Intelligent 
                CPS do not only affect the security of information but also the safety of system, which may lead to malfunction of systems with severe financial, 
                environmental and health losses.The goal of the 2020 SecICPS workshop is to bring together internationally leading academic and industrial researchers 
                in an effort to identify and discuss the major technical challenges and recent results to meet the security and safety requirements of future 
                ICPS’s applications in various fields.
                </p>

            <p>We solicit high quality position papers and research papers that address opportunities and challenges at the areas of hardware security, 
                intelligent system security, application security and network security. We welcome contributions to all relevant research on attacks on ICPS, 
                hardware protections, secure software modelling and verification, security and safety analysis, network security and so on.
                </p>

            <p>Particular areas of interest include, but are not limited to:
            </p>

            <ul>

                <li> Attacks on ICPS including spoofing, eavesdropping, side-channel attack and so on.</li>
